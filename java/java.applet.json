{"desc": "Provides the classes necessary to create an applet and the classes an applet\nuses to communicate with its applet context.\nThe applet framework involves two\nentities: the applet and the applet context. An applet is an\nembeddable window (see the Panel class) with a few extra methods that the applet\ncontext can use to initialize, start, and stop the applet.\nThe applet context is an application that is responsible for loading and running\napplets. For example, the applet context could be a Web browser or an applet\ndevelopment environment.\n", "entries": [{"desc": "This interface corresponds to an applet's environment: the\ndocument containing the applet and the other applets in the same\ndocument.", "link": "AppletContext", "name": "AppletContext", "type": "Interface"}, {"link": "AppletStub", "name": "AppletStub", "type": "Interface"}, {"link": "AudioClip", "name": "AudioClip", "type": "Interface"}, {"desc": "An applet is a small program that is intended not to be run on\nits own, but rather to be embedded inside another application.", "link": "Applet", "name": "Applet", "type": "Class"}]}
