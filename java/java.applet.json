The applet framework involves two entities: the applet and the applet context. An applet is an embeddable window (see the Panel class) with a few extra methods that the applet context can use to initialize, start, and stop the applet. The applet context is an application that is responsible for loading and running applets. For example, the applet context could be a Web browser or an applet development environment. "}
