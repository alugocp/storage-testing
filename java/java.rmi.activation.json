A remote object's reference can be made ``persistent'' and later activated into a ``live'' object using the RMI activation mechanism. Implementations are not required to support the activation mechanism. If activation is not supported by this implementation, several specific activation API methods are all required to throw UnsupportedOperationException. If activation is supported by this implementation, these methods must never throw UnsupportedOperationException. These methods are denoted by the presence of an entry for UnsupportedOperationException in the Throws section of each method's specification. "}
