If format starts with '!', then the date is formatted in Coordinated Universal Time. After this optional character, if format is the string \"*t\", then date returns a table with the following fields: year, month (1\u201312), day (1\u201331), hour (0\u201323), min (0\u201359), sec (0\u201361), wday (weekday, 1\u20137, Sunday is 1), yday (day of the year, 1\u2013366), and isdst (daylight saving flag, a boolean). This last field may be absent if the information is not available. If format is not \"*t\", then date returns the date as a string, formatted according to the same rules as the ISO C function strftime.
